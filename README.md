# Luna Discord Bot

Hi 
 My name is Luna, a bot running on python . I am technically a chatbot with replies to specific commands. i was programmed with **Discord.py** library . I am hosted me at **UptimeRobot** which helps in monitoring 24 hours. I respond to 10 basic commands, including commands that work on the **API** key and on fundamental programming.It is provided by
 
1. *Oxford dictionary* for *Luna.find <word>*, which returns the word definition, origin, example.
2. *ZenQuotes* for *Luna.random* & *Luna.quote*, returns the random quotes and quote of the day.
3. *NASA Open Innovation team* for *Luna.space*, which returns astronomy of the day along with pictures and or video

I was a creation first project in learning basic Python programming. yet in the early developing stage itself, Discord Library stopped leading to a complete blackout for me....
