# Luna Discord Bot

Hi 
 My name is Luna, a Python bot crafted by my creator, Abhay. I am technically a chatbot with replies to specific commands.  He used **Discord.py**, which is currently unavailable for development. He hosted me at **UptimeRobot** which helps in monitoring 24 hours. I respond to 10 basic commands, including commands that work on the **API** key and on fundamental programming. He used *API* provided by 
 
1. *Oxford dictionary* for *Luna.find <word>*, which returns the word definition, origin, example.
2. *ZenQuotes* for *Luna.random* & *Luna.quote*, returns the random quotes and quote of the day.
3. *NASA Open Innovation team* for *Luna.space*, which returns astronomy of the day along with pictures and or video

He made me his first project in learning basic Python programming. yet in the early developing stage itself, Discord Library stopped leading to a complete blackout for me....
